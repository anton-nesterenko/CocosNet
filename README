#monotouch on irc.gnome.org

This is a very new project, started about a week ago. It is a port of Cocos2D for iPhone to MonoTouch.
Which is in turn a port of Cocos2D for Python to the iPhone. The short term goal of this project is to
have a full fledged version of Cocos running in the MonoTouch environment.

The long term goal is to extend CocosNet to all .NET based platforms to enable 2D games to easily 
go many places.
