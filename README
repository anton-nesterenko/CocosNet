#monotouch on irc.gnome.org

This is a new project, started early October 2009. It is a port of Cocos2D for iPhone to MonoTouch.
Which is in turn a port of Cocos2D for Python to the iPhone. The short term goal of this project is to
have a full fledged version of Cocos running in the MonoTouch environment.

The long term goal is to extend CocosNet to all .NET based platforms to enable 2D games to easily 
go many places.

Please see the LICENSE file for licensing information



TO RUN
======
- Compile CocosNetLib and CocosNetTests (You can just open the root .sln file in MonoDevelop and hit Cmnd-b)
- Launch in the simulator or on a device, one of the ported tests should start.
- Go into Main.cs in CocosNetTests and change the instantiated Scene to change the test. It's commented like this

			// To run a different test, instantiate a different class here
			// SpriteTest -- SpriteManual
			// ParallaxTest -- Parallax1
			Scene scene = new Scene(new SpriteManual());



PORTED THUS FAR
==========
The following generally works well in CocosNet

The main infrastructure
- Director
- CocosNode, TextureNode, AtlasNode
- Layer, Scene
- TextureMgr
- Label,
- Camera
- Drawing primitives
- etc

Texture Related
- Texture2D
- PVRTexture

Atlases
- TextureAtlas and LayerAtlas

Menus
- Menu
- MenuItemImage

Actions
- most sprite oriented actions implemented
- see SpriteTest.cs and the Actions namespace

Parallax
- ParallaxNode
- see ParallaxTest.cs

Particle Systems
- ParticleSystem base class, PointParticleSystem
- most point examples
- ParticleTest.cs


CONTRIBUTING and DEVELOPMENT
==========
If you would like to contribute anything, please do. You can fork on github, send me patches, whatever. I will credit
all contributors in the AUTHORS file.

This project is a supporting project to my main iPhone development. In other words, I am writing some games and
using CocosNet as their engine. So I am porting things to CocosNet mostly on an as needed basis for me. So I don't
always work on CocosNet directly, but rest assured it's always in my sights and will receive regular love.
