#monotouch on irc.gnome.org

This is a very new project, started about a week ago. It is a port of Cocos2D to MonoTouch. Which is inturn a port of Cocos to the iPhone.
The short term goal of this project is to have a full fledged version of Cocos running in the MonoTouch environment.
The long term goal is to extend CocosNet to all .NET based platforms to enable 2D games to easily go all over the place. 
For now MonoTouch is the focus, and then all .NET platforms that have OpenGL bindings will be the next focus, then any environments
that require a different graphics lib such as XNA on the Xbox.
