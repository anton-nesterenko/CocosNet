#monotouch on irc.gnome.org

This is a very new project, started about a week ago. It is a port of Cocos2D for iPhone to MonoTouch.
Which is in turn a port of Cocos2D for Python to the iPhone. The short term goal of this project is to
have a full fledged version of Cocos running in the MonoTouch environment.

The long term goal is to extend CocosNet to all .NET based platforms to enable 2D games to easily 
go many places.

TO RUN
======
- Compile CocosNetLib and Cocos2DPortedTests (You can just open the root .sln file in MonoDevelop and hit Cmnd-b)
- Launch in the simulator, one of the ported tests should start.
- Go into Main.cs in Cocos2DPortedTests and change the instantiated Scene to change the test. It's commented like this

			// To run a different test, instantiate a different class here
			// SpriteTest -- SpriteManual
			// ParallaxTest -- Parallax1
			Scene scene = new Scene(new SpriteManual());
