<h2>CocosNet is...</h2>

<p>A port of <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org">Cocos2D for the iPhone</a> to the <a href="http://monotouch.net">MonoTouch</a> platform. Cocos2D for the iPhone was in turn a port of <a href="http://www.cocos2d.org">Cocos2D</a> which is written in Python.</p>

<p>CocosNet currently targets MonoTouch for the iPhone and iPad, but it has an ultimate goal of being used in just about any .NET environment (Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox, etc).</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>Please see the LICENSE file for licensing info. CocosNet carries the same license as Cocos2D for the iPhone.</p>

<h2>Contributors</h2>

<p>Please see the AUTHORS file for a list of contributors</p>

<h2>How to run</h2>

<ul>
<li>Compile CocosNetLib and CocosNetTests</li>
<li>You can just load CocosNET.sln into MonoDevelop and build it (Cmnd-B)</li>
<li>Launch into the simulator or your device</li>
<li>By default, cmnd-shift-enter in MonoDevelop should do this</li>
<li><p>You will be launching the test app, which will load one of the tests and run it.
To see which test is launched and/or change it, look at Main.cs in CocosNetTests and change the instantiate scene, the code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  // To run a different test, instantiate a different class here  
  // SpriteTest -- SpriteManual  
  // ParallaxTest -- Parallax1  
  Scene scene = new Scene(new SpriteManual());
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Contribute</h2>

<p>CocosNet is my first open project like this, please bear with me if I'm not the best coordinator just yet :)</p>

<h3>Small Contribution: Send me a patch</h3>

<p>If you would like to contribute something small (ideally all in one file), please send me a patch. This is very easy to do with Git, here is a nice <a href="http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/">tutorial</a> on how to do that.</p>

<h3>Large Contribution: fork on GitHub</h3>

<p>If you would like to contribute a large bug fix, feature, etc, please fork my main branch on github, add your work, and let me know and I will pull it into the main branch.</p>

<p>Please see the ContributorsGuide.txt file (in the same directory as this file you are reading) for detailed information on contributing to CocosNet: what is needed, how I am approaching the port, reporting/dealing with bugs, etc.</p>
