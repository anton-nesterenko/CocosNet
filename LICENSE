CocosNet license:
---------------------------

CocosNet would like to use the LGPL v3 license.
But since it is impossible to distribute 3rd party dynamic libraries
for the iPhone, this license extends the GNU LGPL v3 license by allowing you: 
  a) to use CocosNet as a static library
  b) to include all or part of the CocosNet sources inside your project

This means that if you do a) and/or b) you are NOT forced to release your 
source code under the GNU LGPL v3 license.

What is an improvement to the library and what's part of your game is
decided by your own good faith.

Remember that CocosNet follows the copyleft idea. So if you think that
you're improving the library, share your changes with the community with this
same license.


If you have any doubt regarding the license, please contact Matthew Greer.
